Ok. I'll hold off on sending new information to you for now.
Bummer. You won't get any more announcements.
Done. You’ve been unsubscribed. I’ll be here if you ever need me.
Your wish is my command.
Unsubscribed :(
I'm at a loss for words. Well, not a complete loss, so here’s two, “You're unsubscribed.”
Ok… if you really want to go. Keep on marketing for me!
No more notifications. :(
No problem, but I did not expect this. 😱 #shocked #unsubscribed
Unsubscribed = true
You got it. No more announcements for you. Let me know if you’d like to subscribe again.
You are scrubbed from the subscriber list!
