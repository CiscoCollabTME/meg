I wish I could help with that and maybe one day I will. But not today. I can help with your announcement subscription. You could always search for more information on [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/market.html) 
If you want to manage your subscription, I'm your woman. However, it’s going to take some time for me to learn all this new stuff. In the meantime, feel free too search for more information on [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/market.html).
Ok… I read about that once, on a plane. Although I'm much better at Global Partner Marketing announcements. You can always find more information on [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/market.html)
In human years, I'm like an infant, but I'm still growing. One day, I'll respond correctly to that request. For now, you may need to dig a little deeper on your own at [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/market.html).
Some day I will be skilled enough to answer that. Not yet though. Until then, I'll limit myself to Global Partner Marketing Announcements. If you want to search for that information on [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/market.html) please do!
I haven’t prepped on this topic. Maybe that information could be found on [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/market.html)?
You got me. I don’t have an answer for that one right now. Why don’t you check out [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/market.html) for more information!
