I wish I could speak another language… at least one of the 20+ that Webex Teams supports, but I don’t for now.
Even though Webex Teams supports more than 20 languages, I only know English.
I spent my early years studying Latin… turns out no one speaks it anymore (not even me). It's not even one of the languages that Webex Teams supports. Go figure.
